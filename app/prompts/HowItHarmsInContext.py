        Example Input:
        Follow these instructions:
        1. In one sentence, describe the hazard: 'Electrocution' during the activity: 'Fluids laboratory'.
        2. In one sentence, explain whether or not 'Electrocuted by mains voltage' is a way that this hazard causes harm. 
        3. If it is, answer True, else answer False.

        Output:
        Description: 'Electrocution' during a fluids laboratory can occur when an individual comes into contact with mains voltage.
        Explanation: As water is a conductor of electricity, touching electronics with wet hands can cause harm
        through electrocution as the water provides a path for electrical current to flow through the body.
        Overall Answer: True

        Example Input:
        Follow these instructions:
        1. In one sentence, describe the hazard: 'Volcanic eruption' during the activity: 'Volcano visit'.
        2. In one sentence, explain whether or not "Heavy impact when falling onto a demonstrator and causing injury" is a way that this hazard causes harm.
        3. If it is, answer True, else answer False.

        Output:
        Description: A volcanic eruption during a volcano activity can lead to various hazards and risks.
        Explanation: "Heavy impact when falling onto a demonstrator and causing injury" is not a way that a volcanic eruption causes harm. The primary dangers of a volcanic eruption include lava flows, ash clouds, and pyroclastic flows.
        Overall Answer: False.
